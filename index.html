  <p class="w3-center"><em>EVELYN DANG S3785786</em></p>
  <p>I was born in Melbourne on the 2nd of January 2001. My hobbies are similar to everyone else’s, I like to sleep, watch Netflix/Youtube and going out with my friends. I’ve played badminton since I was eleven but have always been a swimmer and really enjoyed netball. My all time favourite sport would be track and field, in particular, long jump, high jump and 200m sprint but I never went further with it than school athletics days. I grew up  in the western suburbs with my parents and younger brother until I was twelve and moved to the south east, where I graduated from Mentone Girls’ Secondary College last year. Now I’m studying Information Technology at RMIT. The only language I speak at home is English but I can speak very basic cantonese. I have a pet red ear slider turtle whose name is Turt, although we only recently found out she was a girl after calling her a boy for the past three years.

      <p>I have a fascination with history, especially WW2 and Australia during the gold rush years. My all time dream in life is to be able to help those in developing countries, whether that’s providing education or funding health care services, opening high end orphanages in many countries and try to lessen the injustice that many face.</p>

  <h3 class="w3-center">INTEREST IN IT</h3>
  <p>My interest in IT stems from my everyday use of IT whether it’s from my phone, laptop or everything around my life. The idea of having my own control when it comes to improving or expanding the workings of the application for example excites me knowing I don’t have to only be a user and its a two way working. My interest in IT expanded when I realised it will lead me to an interesting and flexible (the word thats like different) future career that can exercise my creative and problem solving skills. 
The reason I chose to study IT at RMIT was because of the good IT and Business facility and its respectable university status. RMIT was also the ideal place to study because of the easy thirty five minute train ride that I need to take everyday. 
Whilst studying, I expect to learn the basics of many different software programs that I will come across  and need while working in future IT jobs.

  <p>My Ideal job and the job that attracts me is a Business Analyst. A business analyst is required to produce business requirement documents and build functional and technical specification documents, meaning they design and specify how the system or web page would look and function in an efficient manner for the user and produce solution designs.   This job position appeals to me because I am able to build and improve on a website or system’s quality and focus on user needs and as a user it would be easier to see the success of the project through both the creator and user’s eyes. The diversity in challenges of projects also excites me as projects may be internal within the business as well as working with stakeholders within other government agencies such as the Australian Taxation Office.<p>

<p>The IT skills required for the position include advanced uses of PL/SQL, MS Excel, Bootstrap (version 4), HTML and CSS, JQuery and Javascript, Cloudflare, ASP.Net Core MVC, Liquid Planner for Project Management, Indesign, knowledge of RDMS. The position also searches for employees with exceptional problem solving skills, business intelligence solutions like reporting and analytics, experience with solutions provider within superannuation and excellent communication and presentation skills whether it is written or verbal. To be qualified for this role, companies require the potential employee to have a TAFE certificate or University degree preferably majoring in IT or Business studies.
The skills I’ve currently obtained whilst working casually include strong customer service skills and customer focus consistently ensuring customer satisfaction. I also have the ability to interact with people from a diverse range of backgrounds proven through customer service experience and working in high school team projects. My experience being part of girl guides exercised my role as a logical team member and leader, whilst also being able to independently come up with solutions to problems.<P>
 </div>
<P>Although I haven’t been exposed to many IT skills, I plan to develop the basic skills and become familiar with software programs such as SQL and others with the completion of my bachelor’s degree of Information Technology. After graduating I plan to experience a range of different part time IT jobs that will allow me to implement what I have learnt in the course but also expand on those skills and learn more that will slowly promote me to higher positions in the IT field. <P>

  <p class="w3-center"><em>question2: The results of these tests can show not only my behaviour with other people but also how I approach tasks given to me. For example, my MBTI test indicates that I make my decisions based more on emotions rather than thinking things through, so in a team situation I may not make decisions that feel right in case I hurt someone’s feelings. But overall, with the results showing I am an entertainer, I can lighten a situation if the group project is stressful or bring fun in a project so others may not feel tense, awkward or
