  <p class="w3-center"><em>EVELYN DANG S3785786</em></p>
  <p>I was born in Melbourne on the 2nd of January 2001. My hobbies are similar to everyone else’s, I like to sleep, watch Netflix/Youtube and going out with my friends. I’ve played badminton since I was eleven but have always been a swimmer and really enjoyed netball. My all time favourite sport would be track and field, in particular, long jump, high jump and 200m sprint but I never went further with it than school athletics days. I grew up  in the western suburbs with my parents and younger brother until I was twelve and moved to the south east, where I graduated from Mentone Girls’ Secondary College last year. Now I’m studying Information Technology at RMIT. The only language I speak at home is English but I can speak very basic cantonese. I have a pet red ear slider turtle whose name is Turt, although we only recently found out she was a girl after calling her a boy for the past three years.

      <p>I have a fascination with history, especially WW2 and Australia during the gold rush years. My all time dream in life is to be able to help those in developing countries, whether that’s providing education or funding health care services, opening high end orphanages in many countries and try to lessen the injustice that many face.</p>

  <h3 class="w3-center">INTEREST IN IT</h3>
  <p>My interest in IT stems from my everyday use of IT whether it’s from my phone, laptop or everything around my life. The idea of having my own control when it comes to improving or expanding the workings of the application for example excites me knowing I don’t have to only be a user and its a two way working. My interest in IT expanded when I realised it will lead me to an interesting future career that can exercise my creative and problem solving skills through a diverse range of projects.  I also find it fascinating how the internet connects people, no matter where you are in the world. It's able to bring people together and allow them to feel a sense of belonging outside of their very own backyard. It's also able to further educate, having more access to resources and exposure to knowledge. 
The reason I chose to study IT at RMIT was because of the good IT and Business facility and its respectable university status. RMIT was also the ideal place to study because of the easy thirty five minute train ride that I need to take everyday. 
Whilst studying, I expect to learn the basics of many different software programs that I will come across and need while working in future IT jobs and finish with a certificate that will open many job opportunities up for me.

  <p>My Ideal job and the job that attracts me is a Business Analyst. A business analyst is required to produce business requirement documents and build functional and technical specification documents, meaning they design and specify how the system or web page would look and function in an efficient manner for the user and produce solution designs.   This job position appeals to me because I am able to build and improve on a website or system’s quality and focus on user needs and as a user it would be easier to see the success of the project through both the creator and user’s eyes. The diversity in challenges of projects also excites me as projects may be internal within the business as well as working with stakeholders within other government agencies such as the Australian Taxation Office.<p>

<p>The IT skills required for the position include advanced uses of PL/SQL, MS Excel, Bootstrap (version 4), HTML and CSS, JQuery and Javascript, Cloudflare, ASP.Net Core MVC, Liquid Planner for Project Management, Indesign, knowledge of RDMS. The position also searches for employees with exceptional problem solving skills, business intelligence solutions like reporting and analytics, experience with solutions provider within superannuation and excellent communication and presentation skills whether it is written or verbal. To be qualified for this role, companies require the potential employee to have a TAFE certificate or University degree preferably majoring in IT or Business studies.
The skills I’ve currently obtained whilst working casually include strong customer service skills and customer focus consistently ensuring customer satisfaction. I also have the ability to interact with people from a diverse range of backgrounds proven through customer service experience and working in high school team projects. My experience being part of girl guides exercised my role as a logical team member and leader, whilst also being able to independently come up with solutions to problems.<P>
 </div>
<P>Although I haven’t been exposed to many IT skills, I plan to develop the basic skills and become familiar with software programs such as SQL and others with the completion of my bachelor’s degree of Information Technology. After graduating I plan to experience a range of different part time IT jobs that will allow me to implement what I have learnt in the course but also expand on those skills and learn more that will slowly promote me to higher positions in the IT field. <P>

  <p class="w3-center"><em>
  <p>These results show who I really am and my personality based on my response to certain questions. These results are made to show how you truly are as a person and now how you or the people around you perceive you. The learning style test is most beneficial to me as an individual to complete tasks and learn at the best of my ability. The test deemed me as 45% tactile, saying a learn though carrying out the task and doing it on my own rather than listening or watching. By knowing this, I wont waste time trying to listen to audio recordings or watch educational videos, rather jump straight into experimenting myself and problem solving. <p>

<p>The results of these tests can show not only my behaviour with other people but also how I approach tasks given to me. For example, my MBTI test indicates that I make my decisions based more on emotions rather than thinking things through, so in a team situation I may not make decisions that feel right in case I hurt someone’s feelings. However, my decision making based strictly on work is mostly prospecting meaning I am open to ideas, and flexible, allowing ideas from others be heard and worked on rather than having a straight vision and being stubborn. But overall, with the results showing I am an entertainer, I can lighten a situation if the group project is stressful or bring fun in a project so others may not feel tense, awkward or not motivated to work on the project. The results of my personality test shows high levels (92%) of neuroticism meaning I am very emotional but can also connect and feel sympathy to others, forming a sense of trust within the group if feelings come into play. <p>

<p>The test results are necessary to form the best team. Having a mix of different personalities that compliment each other rather than clash will increase team performance, whereas if personality clashing between members is present, the level of productivity will be low as more of the focus is on bickering and disagreements due to two stubborn members for example.<p>

  <h3 class="w3-center">PROJECT IDEAS</h3>
   <p class="w3-center"><em>Appliance Control App</em></p>
  <p> An IT project idea that I’ve come up with is a mobile application that alarms the user, who has left their home, whenever a light is still on, a door is unlocked or a stove is still on. The app should go beyond that and have a function on the app that allows the user to turn the lights and stove off and lock or close any doors. Overtime, the project will have additional features for different parts of the home. The project will also include the use of specific lights, stoves and doors that will be capable of syncing with the app. As well as special made stoves, lights and doors that are designed specifically for the app to be able to sync.<p>

<p>In 2018, CFA reported 1588 preventable house fires in Victoria alone. With the use of the application, the alarm or notification feature will warn the homeowner that their stove is still on and allows them to turn it off through the app. This will prevent many house fires and slowly reduce the rates whether in Victoria alone or hopefully, all around the world. The rates of robbery in Australia will also decrease from a recorded number of 225,900 (Budget Direct, 2017) incidents. By simply alerting the homeowner a door is unlocked or open, they can either quickly return home or control from the app, this will easily prevent strangers from breaking into the home. Using home automation software for this project will end or at least lessen these occurrences for everyday people. <p>

<p>The app will firstly have a feature that allows users to put in their location so that when they leave their home, the app will automatically turn on and start scanning once the user is at least 100m away from their home. This will allow the user to easily turn back around and close or lock any doors the app has detected opened or turn off any lights or the stove. Once a notification or alarm appears, there is an option to say there are other people home or allows you to ignore it. There will be alerts every 10 minutes if the user does not respond to the alert. The app will run without requiring an Internet connection so that users will get an alert wherever they may be even if they are not connected to wifi. Similar to the alarm app on the iPhone, alarms will go off and make sound even if the phone is on silent, I want the app to have this feature so there is no risk of the user getting a stove on warning and it being too late. After detecting a risk, and identifying the user is far away from their house, the app will allow the user to turn off their stove or light or lock their door simply by pressing a button. A message will pop up saying it had been successful to validate and lessen the user’s worry. An alternative and an upgrade to purchasing accordant appliances will be to have a small extension that can connect to all the appliances in the home and can be controlled by the app.<p> 

<p>To produce this application, multiple software programs are required. Firstly, programs like Appery .io will allow me to build the mobile app itself for both Android and iOS.
as well as home automation software like Home Assistant or HomeKit. These home automation softwares are used in similar apps such as Google Home which inspired this project. At the moment, HomeKit focuses on lightbulb control through smartphones, this software will be similar to the one needed for the project as turning lights off an on is part of the app. A software program will also be needed for the detection aspect of the app, to identify when a stove is on or a door is unlocked.<p>  

<p>There are many skills needed to for the project to be as successful as it can be. Focusing on the overall appearance and management of the app, the main skills required will be immense product management skills so that the app will always be in line with the user’s needs and wants as the apps main goal is to assist the user as best as possible, as well as design skills so it attracts both users and potential users also making sure it is easy for everyone to use, regardless of age or disadvantages. The syncing process should be made easy with only a few clicks through bluetooth and navigation of the app so that users come to rely on the app. Running the app will need clean and exceptional coding skills and knowledge of Java, HTML, C++, CCS and UI framework to list a few. Also data skills to collect the end results and work with the results to improve on the app. <p>

<p>It is ideal that majority of the population invest in the app or rely on it as the problems it aims to tackle are negatively life changing, yet preventable. Therefore, if the project is successful in the number of users and how accurate the app runs, house fires from stoves left on unattended and home invasions will decrease immensely  
However, some drawbacks to this project may be that users end up relying too much on the app and lose their cautiousness when leaving the house and following routine of checking stoves and locking doors, instead they may walk out and expect an alarm or notification to go off on their phone. It may be a timely process to sync every light in the house or purchase new ones compatible with the app. The cost of the instalment of the specific stoves, lights and doors will be quite an investment for some or an unnecessary cost, especially for those who live in older homes that will need the full installation. Whereas, in newer homes, those will already be built in on request. To tackle the cost problem, there may be free installation around the neighbourhood to get users familiar with the app.<p>
